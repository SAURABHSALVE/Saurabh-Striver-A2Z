# Example 1:
# Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
# Output: 
# [
# [1,1,6],
# [1,2,5],
# [1,7],
# [2,6]]
# Explanation: These are the unique combinations whose sum is equal to target.
 
# Example 2:
# Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5
# Output: [[1,2,2],[5]]
# Explanation: These are the unique combinations whose sum is equal to target.
